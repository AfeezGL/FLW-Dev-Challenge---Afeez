# FLW-Dev-Challenge---Afeez
#My entry for Flutterwave Developer Challenge
Project name: Jumga
Jumga is an ecommerce web application that helps small businesses get an online presence without breaking the bank.

#How it works:
Businesses register themselves on the website
Get their online store activated
We connect them with a dispatch rider in the same region.

Yes it's that simple.

At the point of sales payment are settled with the flutterwave API for easy payments.

#How do we make profit from this:
Jumga gets a commission of 7.5% on each sales
Jumga also gets a commission of 20% of the delivery fees.
The store owner's account balance is credited at the point of sales while that of the dispatch rider is credited when the goods get delivered.

They can both withdraw their money to their respective bank accounts in the currency set by the store.

The four supported countries are Nigeria, Kenya Ghana, United Kingdom with their currencies.
